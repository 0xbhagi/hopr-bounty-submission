### Job Story

<!--- Dune Analytics example: 

HOPR monitors its staking seasons using Dune analytics dashboards. In essence, people can stake HOPR tokens and receive a reward for locking their tokens into the smart contract. You can find the current dashboard for staking season 5 [here](https://dune.com/hoprnet/hopr-staking-season-5). You can read more about our current staking season 5 [here](https://medium.com/hoprnet/hopr-staking-5-0-b00007b4e4bf) and you can find the latest deployment on Gnosis Chain [here](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xd80fbBFE9d057254d80eEbB49f17aCA66a238e2D0BB1Ff7A9b3f2c87267626630aa0195cAE3ed5E3/contracts) -->

### Description

<!--- Dune Analytics example: 

Dune is changing its whole database architecture. You can read more about it [here](https://dune.com/docs/reference/dune-v2/query-engine/). In this bounty you will replicate the following queries in the new Dune Engine v2 (Spark SQL). You can find the HOPR staking season 5 smart contract by selecting Dune Engine v2 (Spark SQL) as the database in Dune, search for hopr_protocol and select HoprStakeSeason5. The required changes to make the queries run in the new engine should be minimal (hint: Often it will be just required to change the FROM statement in SQL). -->
